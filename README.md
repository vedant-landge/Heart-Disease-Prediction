# Heart-Disease-Prediction

This repository contains all the materials related to my project on predicting heart disease using various machine learning algorithms. The project is based on a comprehensive dataset amalgamated from multiple databases, offering a diverse array of patient data anonymized to protect privacy. The primary objective is to leverage machine learning to aid in the early detection and accurate diagnosis of heart disease, a leading cause of mortality worldwide.

Contents:

heart.csv: The dataset used for model training and evaluation, dating back to 1988 and sourced from Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V databases.
Machine_Learning_Project.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the full pipeline of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.
requirements.txt: A list of Python packages required to run the notebook.
Model_Performance_Images: A folder containing visualizations of the models' performance, including correlation matrices, distribution histograms, PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP results, along with confusion matrices and accuracy comparisons.
Project_Report.docx: The final project report detailing the methodology, results, and conclusions of the study.
Models Evaluated:

Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
